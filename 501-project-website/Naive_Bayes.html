<h3><b><i>Naive Bayes: </h3><h5>It is a classification technique based on the Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independent among predictors. It is 
          usually used in document classification problems based on discrete features. Naive Bayes is easy and fast to make predictions and could make
          better comparsions with other mdoels.</h5>
</i></b>
<br>
<br>

<p>For this section, it is time to work with the Naive Bayes Classification. And the classifier that is used MultinomialNB. 
    However, it is necessary to do some steps for the data preparation for analysis. Therefore, for python, since we did tokenization before,
    we still need to find positive and negative words from each tokenized column and add them to a new column. Then the dataset is ready to do 
    whether tfidf or prediction. In python, we use Naive Bayes to do sentiment analysis of tweets on the topic of climate change. For the R section, we did use
    Naive Bayes to predict the relationship between the number of words and the probability of words. Using visualization to show the output is a good way, 
    so for the python part, we use heatmap and barplot to display the accuracy and confusion matrix output. We used a bar plot and confusion matrix for the R part to show the result.  
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h5><b>Conclusion:</b></h5>
<p>For Naive Bayes Classification, we find out that the relationship between truth and prediction shows in the table below. And it also gives an 
    accuracy result of 71%. The Confusion Matrix predicts the sentiment analysis of climate change topics with positive, negative, and both positive and negative emotions.
    It clearly shows the relationship between truth and prediction with those three different emotions.

<br>
<p>The bar plot below shows the comparison of train data accuracy and test data accuracy of sentiment analysis. It could find out that the training accuracy is 64.3%, and 
    the test accuracy is 71.4%. We could notice that the test accuracy is higher than the training accuracy. It might be because the 
    difference between the two is large.

<br>
<br>
<p>The bar plot below compares train data misclassification accuracy and test data misclassification accuracy. And it related to the total number of words in the tweets data. And through the plot, it is easy to notice that
    the training and testing accuracy should be 1 - misclassification accuracy. Therefore, the training accuracy is 99.5%, and the testing accuracy is 99.3%. The accuracy is high, which means the prediction of the total number of words gives a
    good result.

<br>
<br>
<p>For predicting the performance of the total number of words in tweets data, the confusion matrix graph shown below has given accuracy of 99.5%. We also get the Kappa coefficient accuracy is 98.7%. 
    And the Kappa coefficient can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the classification. Therefore, we could notice the performance provided a good result since it has a high accuracy score.
