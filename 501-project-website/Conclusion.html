            <p> To conclude, we used Python to predict our accuracy score of both test and train data for sentiment analysis. That means we could determine how our test and train data works on the sentiment words. And 
                the result that we got is around 64% to 71%. That seems not too bad, but it is still not highly significant. As mentioned above, we did predictions with Naive Bayes methods. And the result seems good, 
                and the sentiment analysis predictions are not too high accuracy scores. However, it 
                might be because we do not have a large dataset to train and predict. So, if we have any chance in the future, we could get more datasets and a larger dataset to redo our predictions. The result will become
                better and more convincing. However, we will also compare our accuracy score of sentiment analysis with other methods, and we will see which one performs best in the end.

                To conclude, the decision tree classifier should be the second model we used to analyze the climate change topic sentiment. Firstly, we could notice that the accuracy score of the test data is higher than the train data. 
                Also, Comparing the accuracy score of test data from both the baseline model and decision tree model, we could notice that the baseline model has a higher accuracy score. Since we are doing the sentiment analysis of the climate change topic, 
                we still need to compare our results with negative and positive words from tweets.
                And the accuracy score is not high, which means it needs some improvement in the future to improve the accuracy. The overall process is on the right track, but it could still improve some details in future work. For example, the dataset is small, 
                so it might be hard to compare the accuracy between each model. And it might also cause lower accuracy of the model. So, we could get a larger dataset of climate change topics of tweets in the future and make our prediction again.

                Lastly, we could get information from the decision tree classifier that people have more negative emotions than positive emotions on the climate change topic. On another side, we could notice some people might see that climate change has become a big issue in the world environment.
                 We could also notice that different classifiers and models could help us dealing and predict various topics. Then it could help us improve ourselves or provide notification to society.

                The SVM classifier is the third model we use in the project. And the SVM classifier is used in a different way than the other two models. Because in this part, we are not doing the sentiment analysis with words in each tweet. In this part, we predicted the correct usage of emotional words. Since we did a baseline model, it also helped us to get accuracy. Then we would like to compare the accuracy results with both the baseline and the SVM models. We got the accuracy from the baseline model is 64%. Since we only get the test data accuracy from the baseline model, we will compare our data accuracy from the SVM model, which is 78.57%. It shows that we get a better accuracy the result from the SVM model.

And we also want to use the accuracy score to check whether the works are good or not and to check how the correctness works. The accuracy is not too high but not too bad in this part. That means we still need some improvements in future work. However, the process is good, and it could be better if we check more models in the future. The accuracy score could also be affected by the size of the dataset. And it might be why the accuracy score is not too high. Therefore, we could obtain a larger dataset to do all processes again, which might result differently.

Lastly, we could get information from the SVM classifier that the correctness of emotion words is not bad; however, it needs a larger dataset to continue and support this idea on the climate change topic. On the other side, we could find out the outcome shows the neutral words has a more significant number and predict more correctly than the other two. Also, predicting the topic with different models could improve the prediction system and notice how people's real emotions on the climate change topic.

                To conclude, we used three clustering methods of our dataset and saw how three of them work. According to our results, we could find out that KMeans works well and represents a good model. And based on its result of distortion and inertia score, it also shows us it is a good model. Moreover, it also offers three clusters separated with positive, neutral, and negative labels from both the original text data and the sentiment words data. Also, it splits into two clusters of negative words or not have negative terms with the relationship between the original tweets text and the sentiment words.

                Lastly, we also work with both DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering. It presents a better result with hierarchical clustering than the DBSCAN. Since we got the silhouette_score from both DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering methods. We could compare the results of silhouette_score of both methods. So, it shows 0.149 for the DBSCAN method and 0.274 for the hierarchical method. Since the silhouette_score is between -1 to 1, and closer to 1 means a better result. We could find out that the hierarchical clustering method works better.

                To conclude, we used ARM and network analysis on our dataset and saw how it works with those methods. We did three groups of transaction data, which include all sentiment words, positive words only , and negative words only. And we could make a comparison based on their results. Based on their network graphs, we could see that the transaction data of negative words only have the least relations and nodes. And comparing with the network graph of positive words only, we could notice that it has more positive words from tweets on the climate change topic, and they have great connections between each word.

                Lastly, since we could get a lot of information from each ARM dataframes, we could conclude that most of the support threshold is closer to 0, which means they are closer to irrelevant from the three ARM results. And most of their lift values are greater than one, and we could say that all of them seem to have positive relations. And also, based on the confidence results, most of them have a strong rule with their item-sets except a few sets. However, based on the dataset we scrapped from Twitter on sentiment analysis, it is only what we get. If we had a larger dataset, the results might change. And also, if we change the time to scrap the tweets, such as a few years ago, it might also change all results. But, based on our dataset, our findings could say that people are starting to pay attention to climate change topics and it has more positive sentiment words through their tweets.</p>

<h5><b>Overall Conclusion:</b></h5>
<p>
    The project's purpose is to do sentiment analysis on climate change topics. Therefore, we used different models and methods to check the accuracy and also did the polarity scores of the tweets' text.
    And the specific details show below:</p>
    
    <p>
    The following images show the result of the polarity scores of our data from tweets text. And it shows an example of the first four texts and their scores. First of all, the table below could give us an idea of what is polarity scores and how they look at. In real-time usage, we could use 
    the data from polarity scores as our source because we could use it to do sentiment analysis of context. That is similar to what we did as below; it shows 
    the example of four different contexts; however, we could look at the first one as an example. We could notice that the neg score is 0, which means the percentage
    of containing negative sentiment words is 0. And the line graph could help us determine the difference between those scores. According to our data, the 
    polarity scores could better understand sentiment analysis and how it works. And it will give people a brief idea of how to do sentiment analysis on climate change. According to the four tweets example, we could say that they have more neutral words in tweets.

    The following image shows the comparison accuracy score between Naive Bayes, Baseline, Decision Tree, and SVM models. The bar graph could help us quickly to compare their accuracy scores.
    We could find that the Baseline Model has the highest accuracy scores, and the Naive Bayes has the second-highest accuracy score. And compared to the specific accuracy
    scores we got from each model. For Naive Bayes, we get 71.4% and 78.6% for the baseline model. Also, we get 57.1% for the Decision Tree model and 50% for the SVM model. Therefore, 
    it could conclude that the algorithm that should be used to understand the sentiment of the climate change tweets should be the Baseline Model (LinearSVC).
</p>
<p>
    Based on this analysis, it has many applications in terms of the future potential of work. In terms of sentiment analysis, we want to use the same four classification models in the future; however, 
    we would like to consider doing it with TF-IDF and trying it with bigrams or word embedding. That could give us more results to compare with and to have a more accurate solution. And sentiment 
    analysis could use as a way to warn people's attention and might change their behavior. So, knowing useful topics and analyzing people's thoughts is essential.
