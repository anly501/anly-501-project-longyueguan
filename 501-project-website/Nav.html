      <p class="card-text">
        Since scientists discovered the climate change issues in the early 19th century, it is still a big problem to have a healthy and safe environment.
         Climate change is not a problem for a specific country, it is a problem for the entire world. It is caused by water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and so on.
          As climate change continues to persist, the temperatures will continue to rise, hurricanes will become more robust, the sea level will rise high, and so on. 
          However, many people still do not know what climate change means and how it will affect their life. 
          It is time that we should understand that the conservation of the climate starts with us making efforts at an individual level.
          <br><br>
          The whole project about climate change has evolved into a pro/anti climate change agenda. 
          The project will focus on analysis methods for sentiment analysis of climate change and also the comparison with different data from different media. 
          The main aim of this project is to see if the following questions could be useful in the real world. 
          And it will focus more on: What are the sentiments of tweets (positive, neutral, or negative)? 
          What is the difference in the sentiment of data from different media?

        Why choosing this topic and why it is important? Here are real-world questions about the climate change topic.
      </b></h6>
      <p>
        1. What are the sentiments of tweets (positive, neutral, or negative)?<br>  
        2. Which are the most common topics in all data?<br>  
        3. How do people’s feelings change about climate change during the past year? <br>
        4. Are people’s feelings change because of covid19? <br>
        5. Which location (country) has the largest number of tweets about climate change?<br>
        6. What is the dominant topic in each tweet?<br>
        7. What is the optimal number of topics?<br>
        8. What is the difference in the sentiment of data from different media? <br>
        9. Are countries that have the largest number of data mentioned about climate change different between tweets and data from other media?<br>
        10. Which are the most common languages using to share about climate change?<br>
