    <h3 class="card-title"><b>Sentiment Analysis of Climate Change</b></h3>
    <p class="card-text">Since scientists discovered the climate change issues in the early 19th century, it is still a big problem to have a healthy and safe environment.
      Climate change is not a problem for a specific country, it is a problem for the entire world. It is caused by water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and so on.
       As climate change continues to persist, the temperatures will continue to rise, hurricanes will become more robust, the sea level will rise high, and so on. 
       However, many people still do not know what climate change means and how it will affect their life. 
       It is time that we should understand that the conservation of the climate starts with us making efforts at an individual level.</p>
       <p class="card-text">
        The whole project about climate change has evolved into a pro/anti climate change agenda. 
          The project will focus on analysis methods for sentiment analysis of climate change and also the comparison with different data from different media. 
          The main aim of this project is to see if the following questions could be useful in the real world. 
          And it will focus more on: What are the sentiments of tweets (positive, neutral, or negative)? 
          What is the difference in the sentiment of data from different media? 
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          And according to the development of technology and any other industry, we are responsible for paying more attention to the climate change topic. Also, the sentiment
          analysis was undertaken to address the lack of agreement among climate researchers and policy-makers over managing change and to determine whether changes were 
          occurring in their development paths. And sentiment analysis shows the overall discussion of how people's emotions work with the climate change topic.
